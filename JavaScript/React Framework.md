# Overview

React frameworks handle the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

# Next.js (App Router)

- https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/what-is-react-and-nextjs

You can use React to build your UI, then incrementally adopt Next.js features to solve common application requirements such as routing, data fetching, and caching - all while improving the developer and end-user experience.

## Routing

Next.js uses file-system based routing, meaning you can use folders and files to define routes.
